## What i learned 

In this project i experienced how to handle navigation beetween screens and share data.
I added a context to handle data and CRUD operations to let the app organized and clean.

So i learned how to manage screens and navigation and handle user input.


## What can be done better

There are some aspects that i would like to handle better, like:

- UX/UI: I dislike the layout of the application, i tried to use a color palette to give it a kindly interface, but i didn't success on that. So i add to my backlog a task for follow a UX/UI course to learn to handle colors, positioning, shapes and interactivity.
- Too simple: The application has a simple CRUD functionality, i would like to add some filter or a calendar, but in that case i will miss the point: the screens handling. This App is born only for that purpose, so i have to put aside my mania for perfectionism.

## Demo
